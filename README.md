Steps to use application:

1. Click on app icon.
2. There are two tabs first is Movies list and second is Favourite movie list.
3. Movies List can be scrollable and new movies will appear on scrolling.
4. User can search movies respectively.
5. User can mark multiple movies as favourite on click of Heart icon on top right.
6. On tap of Favouties movie list , user can watch details of that movie just on the click on that particular movie.
7. User can later check the favourite movie list which was marked as favourite earlier.
8. On search of same movie which is already present in favourite list , That movie will automatically appear as marked favourite. So Blue Heart will appear in that case.


In this project Core data is being used to maintain the states of favourite movies locally. Internet reachability and loader is also maintained  at the time of Api calls. 
Image caching is also done using SDwebImage framework.

I have also Uploaded the video of the Project, You can check and have the idea of using this application.

Thanks
